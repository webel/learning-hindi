## Status

_The way my mother heard it_:

> I've built a couple of things thou, pokus is back on the web (https://webel.github.io/PokusWebsite/), I've finally fixed my website (stenqvist.co), and I'm learning Hindi and couldn't find good enough flashcards... so I built this (https://webel.github.io/learning-hindi/). On my computer I can click on the top half of the flashcard and an Indian voice speaks the letter, then on the bottom half and the voice speaks a word beginning with that letter. But, when I put it up yesterday nothing happens onClick (could you try just to confirm it's not just my phone?)
