## Status

There's quite a bit of hidden functionality that you would miss at a glance!

- There are two different modes; grid mode and flashcard mode, switch between them by double clicking the background (you can swipe left or right on mobile).
- In either mode, you can click at the top of a flashcard to hear the word or letter spoken in Hindi.
- Or, click on the bottom of a flashcard to show the English meaning.
