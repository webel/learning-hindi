Welcome to the first lesson!</h1>\\n<p><strong>इतिहास itihās - History</strong></p>\\n<p>Hindi is an <strong>Indo-Aryan</strong> language, meaning it stems from Sanskrit. Naturally, a major part of Hindi vocabulary finds its roots in <strong>Sanskrit</strong>.<br />\\nHowever, the Mughal influence (of <em>Persianised</em> rulers) has lent several <strong>Persian</strong> (particularly old Persian), <strong>Arabic</strong>, and <strong>Turkish</strong> vocabulary to Hindi.<br />\\nHindi has also only recently undergone another gradual, albeit intentionally designed change the last few hundred years: <em>Sanskritisation</em>. This term refers to the use of words (called <strong>तत्सम tatsam</strong> words: <strong>तत् tat</strong> - there, <strong>सम sam</strong> - same; meaning exactly the same as in Sanskrit) which are straight away picked up from Classical Sanskrit to be used in official, formal occasions while speaking Hindi. This should not be confused with the Sanskrit vocabulary that has evolved over long periods of time and now forms the base of the language.<br />\\nOther than that, Hindi has a plethora of <strong>English</strong> (and occasionally <strong>Portuguese</strong>) loanwords. </p>\\n<p><strong>शब्दावली shabdāvalī - Vocabulary</strong></p>\\n<p>Summarising the previous paragraph, the four basic origins for Hindi words are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Evolved Sanskrit</strong> - most general grammatical rules are followed by this category of words, including identification of any word’s gender.</li>\\n<li><strong>Persian</strong> - most general grammatical rules are <em>not</em> followed by this category of words and have to be remembered by heart, most noticeably their gender.</li>\\n<li><strong>Classical Sanskrit</strong> (formal) - these words generally have different rules for very simple grammatical concepts than those for Evolved Sanskrit words.</li>\\n<li><strong>European</strong> - they mostly follow the general grammatical rules of Evolved Sanskrit words.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This information will be used further in these tips and notes.</p>\\n<h1>लिंग liṅg - Gender</h1>\\n<p>All Hindi <strong>nouns</strong>, <strong>verbs</strong>, and <strong>adjectives</strong> have a gender. There are two genders in Hindi - <strong>masculine (m.)</strong> and <strong>feminine (f.)</strong>. There are a few ways to guess a word’s gender based on its origin:<br />\\n</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Evolved Sanskrit:</strong> <em>most</em> words that end with an <strong>आ ā</strong> sound are masculine (पंखा paṅkh<strong>ā</strong> - fan, m.), while <em>most</em> words that end with an <strong>ई ī</strong> sound are feminine (नदी nad<strong>ī</strong> - river, f.). Moreover, words that end with a consonant sound are masculine (घर gha<strong>r</strong> - house, m.) and those which end in <strong>या yā</strong> are feminine (चिड़िया ciṛi<strong>yā</strong> - bird, f.)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th />\\n<th>masculine</th>\\n<th>feminine</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>ending vowel</td>\\n<td><strong>ा/आ ā</strong></td>\\n<td><strong>ी/ई ī</strong></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>ending sound</td>\\n<td>consonant</td>\\n<td><strong>या yā</strong></td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Persian:</strong> Persian is a genderless language. So, there is no fixed way of identifying the gender of Persian loanwords in Hindi. They have to be learnt by heart. E.g. आदमी ādmī – man (m.), ख़्याल xyāl (m.), हवा havā (f.). In fact, there are instances when both Persian derived and Evolved Sanskrit words that have different genders are used for the same thing, e.g. Sanskrit छाया chāyā (f., according to the table above) and Persian साया sāyā (m., contrary to the table), both of which mean <em>shadow</em>. </p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Classical Sanskrit:</strong> Generally, all Classical Sanskrit loanwords that end in a consonant sound are masculine (संकल्प saṅkalp - oath, m.), and all other words that end in any vowel sound are feminine (सुविधा suvidhā - service, f.; प्रगति pragati – progress, f.).</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>European:</strong> these words are generally assigned a gender based on the gender of the actual Hindi word. E.g. <strong>स्कूल skool</strong> (school) is masculine, since the Hindi word <strong>विद्यालय vidyālay</strong> (school) is masculine.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h1>होना hōnā - to be</h1>\\n<p>Like most languages, the verb <em>be</em> is the most irregular in Hindi. However, <em>all</em> Hindi verbs require it in some or the other form as an auxiliary verb for basic conjugation. This means that you’ll find this verb in some or the other form attached to <em>every</em> other verb.</p>\\n<p>When used as an auxiliary verb, it has the simplest conjugation: <br />\\n</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Pronoun (Eng.)</th>\\n<th>Pronoun (Hindi)</th>\\n<th>होना hōnā</th>\\n<th>be</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><strong>I</strong> (1st person)</td>\\n<td><strong>मैं</strong> maim̐</td>\\n<td><strong>हूँ</strong> hūm̐</td>\\n<td>am</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><strong>He/She/It</strong> (3rd person)</td>\\n<td><strong>यह/वह</strong> yah/vah</td>\\n<td><strong>है</strong> hai</td>\\n<td>is</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h1>Pronouns - यह yah, वह vah</h1>\\n<p>Notice that Hindi has only two words for third person pronouns:<br />\\n</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Pronoun</th>\\n<th>Usage</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><strong>यह</strong> yah</td>\\n<td>Gender-Neutral Pronoun, meaning he, she, it, or this (used when the person/thing is somewhere close or if you’re pointing towards them)</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><strong>वह</strong> vah</td>\\n<td>Gender-Neutral Pronoun, meaning he, she, it, or that (used when the person/thing is at a distance or not present in the scene)</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>Often, यह (yah) is pronounced as <em>yē</em> and वह (vah) is pronounced as <em>vō</em> colloquially.

For example, with पिता (father): मे<strong>रे</strong> पिता भारत में <strong>हैं</strong> - My father is in India; उस<strong>के</strong> पिता अमेरिका से नहीं <strong>हैं</strong> - His father is not from America. </p>\\n<h1>Possession with अपना/अपनी/अपने</h1>\\n<p>In Hindi, sentences like “I eat my apple” seem too redundant (मैं मेरा सेब खाता हूँ). So, a class of three different words are used to <em>replace possessive pronouns when their (pro)noun has been mentioned before</em>.</p>\\n<p>अपना is used for masculine singular objects, अपनी for female singular or plural objects, and अपने for masculine plural objects.\\n<strong>Example:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>मैं <strong>अपना</strong> सेब खाता हूँ। – I eat my apple.<br />\\n</li>\\n<li>तुम <strong>अपनी</strong> किताब पढ़ती हो। - You read your book.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Sometimes, these words can also be used when their noun or pronoun is obvious from the context. For example, when a kid comes up to you, you might ask them “अपना नाम बताओ” – Tell me your name (बताओ – imperative form of <em>tell</em>), where it is obvious that अपना means <em>your</em> (Notice that <em>me</em> is not required in such a sentence).</p>\\n<p>These words also take up the oblique case. For example, वह अपने घर से आती है – She comes from her home (आना - <em>to come</em>; अपना घर changes to अपने घर because of से - <em>from</em>).</p>","title":"Family","name":"Relationships","words":["बहनें","बेटे","मेरे","बेटियाँ","तेरे","उसके","के","आप","पिता","माँ"],"levels_finished":5},{"dependencies":["Family","Animals"],"has_explanation":true,"explanation":"<p>As discussed before, adjectives use the <strong>आ/ई/ए system</strong> with the following endings:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>आ for singular masculine objects,</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>ई for female objects of any number,</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>and ए for plural masculine objects.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Other adjectives end with consonants and are used in the same form for objects of any gender or number.</p>","title":"Adjectives","name":"Adjectives","words":["बहुत","अच्छा","बुरा","लंबा","कैसा","छोटा","कैसी","बुरी","अच्छी","लंबी"],"levels_finished":5},{"dependencies":["Letters 3"],"has_explanation":true,"explanation":"<p>Hindi has 33 basic consonants.

E.g., क् (k).</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h1>Conjunct Consonants</h1>\\n<p>When two or more consonants, some of which do not have a vowel following them, are placed directly next to each other, the tongue requires instantaneously shifting its position. This is represented in Hindi through conjunct consonants. E.g. नम<strong>स्ते</strong> (namastē). This word can be broken down as: <strong>न (na) + म (ma) + स (sa) + ् (delete preceding a) + ते (tē)</strong>, where the conjunct consonant is <strong>स्त sta</strong> (स + ् + त). Notice that because of the <em>halant</em>, the स (sa) gets modified, and only half of it is written, while the remaining part is attached to the following त (ta). Many such conjunct consonants can exist, and the letter modifications follow a general pattern:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>Consonants that have a vertical line at the extreme <em>right</em> notice its disappearance. E.g., स्त sta (स् s + त ta), स्न sna (स् s + न na), न्य nya (न् n + य ya), ग्घ ggha (ग् g + घ gha), त्थ ttha (त् t + थ th), etc.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Consonants that have a vertical line, albeit restricted to the centre, require the <em>curl</em> at the right to extend to the following consonant. E.g., क्ख kkha (क् k + ख kha), फ्या phyā (फ् ph + या yā).</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>According to modern norms, all other kinds of consonants do not show a modification but follow a simple <strong>consonant + halant + consonant</strong> format. E.g., ट्क ṭka. Various other conjunct combinations exist, many of which are no longer used in official documents but continue to be used in some other places. At places where they are not used, the <strong>consonant + halant + consonant</strong> format is used.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Nasal consonants that are vowel-less before another consonant are represented by the <strong>anusvār ं</strong> symbol. E.g., संघ saṅgh (स sa + ङ् ṅ + घ gh[a]), पंच  pañc (as in English <em>punch</em>) (प pa + ञ् ñ + च c[a]), खंड khaṇḍ (ख kha +  ण् ṇ + ड ḍ[a]), बंद band (ब ba + न् n + द d[a]), नींबू nīmbū (नी nī + म् m + बू bū), which would historically be written as सङ्घ, पञ्च, खण्ड, बन्द, and नीम्बू respectively.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Some special characters exist for a few consonant combinations, viz. क्ष kṣa (क् k + ष ṣa), त्र tra (त् t + र ra), and ज्ञ jña (ज् j + ञ ña). <strong>ज्ञ</strong>, however, is pronounced exactly like ग्य gya.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h1>The irregular र</h1>\\n<p>र follows different rules in conjunct combinations.</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th />\\n<th>र् + X</th>\\n<th>X + ् + र</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>E.g.</td>\\n<td><strong>पार्क</strong> pārk</td>\\n<td>प्रदेश pra-dēś</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>break down</td>\\n<td>पा pā + <strong>र् r + क k</strong>[a]</td>\\n<td><strong>प् p + र ra</strong> + दे ē + श ś[a]</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>The second case involves writing the र like a <em>slash</em> symbol below the vowel-less consonant. E.g. प्र pra, क्र kra, द्र dra, घ्र ghra. The first case involves writing the र् like a small <strong>C</strong> above the following consonant. E.g.   र्प rpa, र्क rka, र्द rda, र्घ rgha.</p>","title":"Letters 4","name":"Letters 4","words":["ठ","ड","ढ","ण","ट","प","फ","ब","भ","म"],"levels_finished":5},{"dependencies":["Basics 2"],"has_explanation":true,"explanation":"<h1>Postpositions</h1>\\n<p>Just like English has prepositions (certain words placed before nouns and pronouns that give meaning about their activity, for example, at, by, from, on, in, etc.), Hindi has <strong>postpositions</strong>. These are responsible for the third most challenging grammatical aspect of Hindi as mentioned in <a href=\\"https://www.duolingo.com/skill/hi/Basics-1/tips-and-notes\\">Tips and Notes for Basics 1</a> – the oblique case. The oblique case is a <em>case</em>, i.e. it refers to the small changes (called <em>inflections</em> in the world of linguistics) made at the end of nouns and pronouns when a postposition is placed after them. However, this lesson teaches those sentences which do not require the oblique case, and hence, it will be dealt with in later lessons.</p>\\n<p>So, unlike English, any (usually smaller, monosyllable) word that describes a noun’s activity or description is placed <em>after</em> it (<strong>post</strong>-position). For example:</p>\\n<p>Raj is <strong>in India</strong> - राज <strong>भारत में</strong> है<br />\\nHere, the postposition में  (in) is placed after भारत (India).</p>\\n<p>When used with a different verb:</p>\\n<p>Raj studies <strong>in India</strong> and Julia studies <strong>in America</strong>. -  राज <strong>भारत में</strong> पढ़ता है और जूलिया <strong>अमेरिका में</strong> पढ़ती है। </p>\\n<h1>Possessives</h1>\\n<p>Words denoting possession are also gendered in Hindi. Possessive pronouns are generally different words altogether, while an equivalent of <strong>’s</strong> (का/की/के) is used for other nouns in Hindi. </p>\\n<p><strong>However</strong>, there is a difference. The gender and number of possessive pronouns agrees with the gender and number of the <em>object</em> and not the subject.

At the time of India\'s independence, article 343 of the Indian constitution stated that \\"the official language of the Union [of India] (since India was considered a union of various unrelated states at that time) should become Hindi in <strong>Devanagari script</strong>.\\" This variety of Hindi is called <strong>Modern Standard Hindi</strong>, which you will learn through this course. </p>\\n<p>The Devanagari script is an <strong>abugida</strong>, i.e. it consists of individual ‘units’ that represent a single vowel sound along with a few supporting consonant sounds.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>Each unit consists of a base consonant which is written <em>fully</em>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>The vowel sound <em>followed by</em> the base consonant is expressed as a <strong>vowel mark</strong> (which can be understood as a <em>diacritic</em>, somewhat like the accents in European languages).</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h1>वर्णमाला varṇamālā (Hindi\'s <em>The Alphabet</em>)</h1>\\n<p>The order in which Hindi letters are memorised and generally presented is called the <strong>वर्णमाला (garland of letters)</strong>.

On the other hand, you don’t feel it while pronouncing the <strong>k</strong> sound in <strong>park</strong>.

(Notice that a female would say this sentence)</p>\\n<p>Moreover, in both colloquial and formal situations, the auxiliary verb होना hōnā <em>can</em>  be dropped. This means that the above sentence can also be - मैं पानी <strong>नहीं पीती</strong>। maim̐ pānī <strong>nahīm̐ pītī</strong> - I <strong>don’t drink</strong> water. This means that both sentences are fully valid and equally used. The placement of नहीं nahīm̐ can get somewhat complex with phrasal verbs that will be taught later on.

Contrary to most languages which show the heaviest inflection here, Hindi almost never requires any terminal change in the object (not even the oblique case). For example, मैं <strong>केला</strong> खाता हूँ – I eat <strong>the banana</strong>. Here, banana is the object for the subject <em>I</em> and verb <em>eat</em>. In Hindi, the object केला uses the nominative case endings, and not the oblique case. </p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>The Dative Case:</strong> it is used whenever nouns (as <strong>indirect objects</strong>) are used with <strong>transitive verbs</strong>.

The format for the present continuous tense is:</p>\\n<p><strong>[Verb Root] + [Conjug. of रहना]</strong></p>\\n<p>The forms of रहना used for this tense are different from those of its conjugation for the simple present.</p>\\n<h1>Conjugation</h1>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>sing. Pronoun</th>\\n<th>masc.</th>\\n<th>fem.</th>\\n<th>pl. Pronoun</th>\\n<th>masc.</th>\\n<th>fem.</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>मैं (I)</td>\\n<td>रहा हूँ</td>\\n<td>रही हूँ</td>\\n<td>हम (we)</td>\\n<td>रहे हैं</td>\\n<td>रही हैं</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>तुम (you)</td>\\n<td>रहे हो</td>\\n<td>रही हो</td>\\n<td>तुम (you all)</td>\\n<td>रहे हो</td>\\n<td>रही हो</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>तू (you)</td>\\n<td>रहा है</td>\\n<td>रही है</td>\\n<td>-</td>\\n<td>-</td>\\n<td>-</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>आप (you)</td>\\n<td>रहे हैं</td>\\n<td>रही हैं</td>\\n<td>आप (you all)</td>\\n<td>रहे हैं</td>\\n<td>रही हैं</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>यह/वह (he/she/it)</td>\\n<td>रहा है</td>\\n<td>रही है</td>\\n<td>ये/वे (they)</td>\\n<td>रहे हैं</td>\\n<td>रही हैं</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>For example, मैं सेब <strong>खा रहा हूँ</strong> - I <strong>am eating</strong> an apple.</p>\\n<p>Notice that the vowel sounds for the various forms of <strong>रह</strong> are those of the suffix with <strong>त</strong> in the simple present, while the forms of होना also match the conjugation as an auxiliary verb in the simple present.</p>\\n<h1>आना (to come) and जाना (to go)</h1>\\n<p>These verbs work in a peculiar manner:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>They require the <strong>object</strong> to be in the <strong>oblique case</strong>. The object with these verbs is mostly a place.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>They do not require a particle like ‘to’ in English as the oblique case suffices for it.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For example, मैं <strong>तुम्हारे घर</strong> <em>जाता हूँ</em> और वह <strong>मेरे घर</strong> <em>आता है</em> – I <em>go to</em> <strong>your house</strong> and he <em>comes to</em> <strong>my house</strong> (Here, तुम्हारा घर and मेरा घर take the oblique case)</p>\\n<p>And, मैं <strong>तुम्हारे घर</strong> <em>जा रहा हूँ</em> और तुम <strong>मेरे घर</strong> <em>आ रहे हो</em> - I <em>am going to</em> <strong>your house</strong> and you <em>are coming to</em> <strong>my house</strong>.</p>\\n<h1>To Have</h1>\\n<p>There is no single verb for <em>have</em> in Hindi. Two ways to mention possessions are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>(This has already been mentioned before) <strong>[possessive pronoun]/[noun + का/की/के] + [possession] + है/हैं</strong> - For example, <em>मेरी</em> <strong>दो बेटियाँ</strong> <em>हैं</em> - <em>I have</em> <strong>two daughters</strong> (literally: <em>my</em> <strong>two daughters</strong> <em>are</em>).</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>[pl. form of possessive pronoun]/[noun + के] + पास + है/हैं</strong> –  For example, <em>मेरे पास</em> <strong>एक केला</strong> <em>है</em> - <em>I have</em> <strong>a banana</strong> (literally: <em>near me</em> <strong>banana</strong> <em>is</em>); and <em>राज के पास</em> <strong>एक बिल्ली</strong> <em>है</em> - <em>Raj has</em> <strong>a cat</strong> (literally: <em>near Raj</em> <strong>a cat</strong> <em>is</em>) This form is generally used for things and not people. (पास – near)</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h1>Postpositions Using के</h1>\\n<p>Instead of being simple monosyllables, some postpositions in Hindi use the format: <strong>के + [postposition]</strong>. For example, as just learnt, <strong>के पास</strong>. Other examples include <strong>के लिए</strong> (for), <strong>के ऊपर</strong> (above), <strong>के नीचे</strong> (below), etc.</p>\\n<p>Pronouns take the plural-object form for these postpositions. For example, मेरे पास, उसके पास, जूलिया के पास, etc.</p>","title":"Activity","name":"Activity","words":["चलता","दौड़ती","सड़क","पर","मेज़","नदी","तैरते","खड़ा","बैठा","कुर्सी"],"levels_finished":4},{"dependencies":["Imperatives","Home"],"has_explanation":"","explanation":null,"title":"Places","name":"Places","words":["गाँव","शहर","दिल्ली","वहाँ","कौनसा","गली","जगह","कौनसी","यहाँ","कहाँ"],"levels_finished":2},{"dependencies":["Food"],"has_explanation":true,"explanation":"<h1>Quantitative Interrogative Words</h1>\\n<p>This lesson teaches you the word <strong>कितना</strong> in its various forms.
